  post1: `We do it together," Daenerys urged. "We break the wheel together."

  Jon had come to speak with her, to hear Daenerys defend her actions with her own words, but all she did was spout Targeryen madness. Conquer the entire world, a never-ending war, and herself above all others as the ultimate judge of right and wrong, willing to murder thousands.

  He remembered the words of the man who would always be his father. The most honorable man he'd ever known. "The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die."

  He'd been fighting against what he had to do, but now he was certain. As they embraced he plunged his dagger into the heart of the Mad Queen. Death came swiftly she didn't even have any final words as the shock and betrayal in her eyes faded with her life. He lowered her gently to the floor as Drogon roared.

  He'd know the great beast was smart, even smarter than Ghost, but this was magic. It knew. Somehow it knew and it was coming from him. He backed away from winged death as it landed, but instead it went to Daenerys and nuzzled her like a hound at its dead master. She'd called herself Mother of Dragons, and he knew the stories, but only now did he realize the full truth of them. Drogon mourned what was his mother in every way.

  Jon dodged quickly as Drogon reared to breathe flame. He'd expected to feel the flames but instead the beast aimed at the throne. The damned throne that Daenerys had been telling stories about just minutes before. As the beast gently scooped up the Mother of Dragons and flew away, Jon realized that he'd still underestimated the creature's intelligence.

  "You know nothing, Jon Snow," played once again in his mind. Ygritte. He should have stayed in that cave with her. He'd as good as killed her. Now his only other lover was dead at his own hand. Duty is the death of love. He should have loved Daenerys. That's all she'd asked of him. If he hadn't rejected her, if he hadn't left her alone and isolated when all closest to her turned their backs on her, would this have happened?

  He still knew nothing. Sansa wanted him for the throne, as did Tyrion, but they would name him Queenslayer. He had become Jamie Lannister. What was left for him? He walked to the ledge where a dwindling speck in the sky was all that could be seen of the last dragon. Hundreds of feet below him lay the broken ruins of King's Landing

  He stepped forward.`,

  post2: `"Bran the Broken" came the votes one after another. It had been a surprising solution the Imp offered, but it suited. One after another they pledged until…

  "The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it has for thousands of years," stated Sansa Stark.

  "Fuck this then." Edmure Tully surged to his feet. "The Riverlands, or more properly, the Kingdom of the Rivers and the Hills, was an independent kingdom as well.. If the Seven Kingdoms are to be broken, then let them all be broken. I will not bend my knee to a Northman when even the North will not. I declare myself King of the Riverlands."

  Yara Greyjoy stood as well. "And I am Queen of the Ironborn. If we are not one, we are seven."

  And the wheel turned on.`,
  post3: `Jon felt less than comfortable as he visited Daenerys in her chambers. Varys had attempted to betray his queen. The eunuch had even sounded him out and encouraged him to turn on her. He had refused, but he had said nothing. If he had said something, would it have mattered? Maybe not, but the fact that he had said nothing. That did matter. It had been his duty to say something, and he'd done nothing.

  The execution itself had been gruesome, but all executions were awful. Varys had more than earned it. Treason could not be tolerated. Daenerys had even conducted the execution honorably. The one who passed the sentence should be the one who swung the blade. She had used Drogon's flame, but he was just a weapon in her hand. Jon had never been comfortable carrying out executions, but as with the ones he had done, it had been necessary.

  Daenerys didn't look well. She was visibly distraught when she turned to him. "What did I say would happen if you told your sister?"

  "I don't want it, and that's what I told him." Which was truth, but it had also been treason. He had failed her by saying nothing, and it shamed him. She had also been right about telling Sansa, and that shamed him as well.

  "She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear."

  "I love you, and you will always be my queen."" The words felt wooden in his mouth. They were true, but he hadn't loved her enough not to tell Sansa and Arya, even when she had begged him. She'd been right, he'd been wrong, and his sister had broken her sworn word. Now the distance between him and Daenerys had grown farther.

  "Is that all I am to you? Your queen?"`,

  post4: `No, but they could never be. Daenerys wanted to be queen as much as she wanted to breathe. Her ambition was naked, but honest. He could never be by her side. All he could do was sigh in frustration.

  "All right then, I took you for a man of honor. I never thought you would be the kind of man to abandon the mother of your child."

  He felt like he'd been punched in the gut. "My child?"

  "Our child. You do not know how children are made? Or do you think I dally with every man who pleases my eye?"

  "I…" What? "You…" He bowed his head. "You were right about Sansa. I was wrong. Now I can never be by your side. Always there will be men like Varys who think I should rule, that a king is more natural than a queen, that distrust your being an outsider from Essos, when I am at least of Westeros. Men who just think I would be easier to control. Always they will seek to turn us against each other. I can't be by your side any longer, but I will always serve you. You will always be my queen, and more, inside my heart."

  "That was your reason?" She looked incredulous.`,

  post5: `Jon nodded miserably. There was also that she was his aunt, which had bothered him a little, but she didn't feel like his aunt, and truly that didn't matter any longer. Her naked ambition troubled him… Yet, she had been right time and again. When it mattered the most she'd put her life and dragons on the line and she'd done it for him. It was time for him to be there for her and his child. "I'll be right behind you always."

  She sighed and smiled. "You wonderful, foolish man. You will be my consort, my husband in all but name. Always in the shadow, except when we're alone."

  He felt hope surge inside him. "And that will work? You said we would never be?" And he had understood, she would allow nothing between her and the throne and they could never wed.

  "Not like we could have been. You will have to always defer to me in every way in public. We could have been almost equal."

  But? That was better. "I accept. I never wanted to rule." He knelt down. "I will follow you always, one step behind. Yours in everything."

  Daenerys laughed, joy dancing in her eyes. She grabbed his hand and tugged him up. "Kiss me already."

  .oOo.

  Riding on the back of Drogon in the sky above King's Landing, she heard the bells begin to toll. For a brief moment she considered razing the city anyway. The Seven Kingdoms would never love her, but Jon did and that was enough. Her hand drifted south to her belly, and she would be the mother of her own dragons.`

  post1: `It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way— in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.`,
  post2: ` There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.

  It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.`,
  post3: `France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.`,
  post4: `In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of “the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of sixpence.`

  post1: `I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family. `,
  post2: `As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.`,
  post3: ` Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.

  His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.

  Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife. `,
  post4: `There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame.`,
  post5: `From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me. `,
  post6: `For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.`,
  post7: `The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy—one among the schiavi ognor frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its weakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles. `,
  post8: `When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures. `,
  post9: `Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my Victor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only. `,
  post10: `We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight. While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.`,

  post1: ` Earth maintained an important garrison on
  Asteroid Y-3. Now suddenly it was imperiled with
  a biological impossibility--men becoming plants!


 "Well, Corporal Westerburg," Doctor Henry Harris said gently, "just why
 do you think you're a plant?"

 As he spoke, Harris glanced down again at the card on his desk. It was
 from the Base Commander himself, made out in Cox's heavy scrawl: _Doc,
 this is the lad I told you about. Talk to him and try to find out how he
 got this delusion. He's from the new Garrison, the new check-station on
 Asteroid Y-3, and we don't want anything to go wrong there. Especially a
 silly damn thing like this!`,
  post2: `Harris pushed the card aside and stared back up at the youth across the
 desk from him. The young man seemed ill at ease and appeared to be
 avoiding answering the question Harris had put to him. Harris frowned.
 Westerburg was a good-looking chap, actually handsome in his Patrol
 uniform, a shock of blond hair over one eye. He was tall, almost six
 feet, a fine healthy lad, just two years out of Training, according to
 the card. Born in Detroit. Had measles when he was nine. Interested in
 jet engines, tennis, and girls. Twenty-six years old.

 "Well, Corporal Westerburg," Doctor Harris said again. "Why do you think
 you're a plant?"

 The Corporal looked up shyly. He cleared his throat. "Sir, I _am_ a
 plant, I don't just think so. I've been a plant for several days, now."

 "I see." The Doctor nodded. "You mean that you weren't always a plant?"

 "No, sir. I just became a plant recently."

 "And what were you before you became a plant?"

 "Well, sir, I was just like the rest of you."

 There was silence. Doctor Harris took up his pen and scratched a few
 lines, but nothing of importance came. A plant? And such a
 healthy-looking lad! Harris removed his steel-rimmed glasses and
 polished them with his handkerchief. He put them on again and leaned
 back in his chair. "Care for a cigarette, Corporal?"

 "No, sir."`,
  post3: `The Doctor lit one himself, resting his arm on the edge of the chair.
 "Corporal, you must realize that there are very few men who become
 plants, especially on such short notice. I have to admit you are the
 first person who has ever told me such a thing."

 "Yes, sir, I realize it's quite rare."

 "You can understand why I'm interested, then. When you say you're a
 plant, you mean you're not capable of mobility? Or do you mean you're a
 vegetable, as opposed to an animal? Or just what?"

 The Corporal looked away. "I can't tell you any more," he murmured. "I'm
 sorry, sir."

 "Well, would you mind telling me _how_ you became a plant?"

 Corporal Westerburg hesitated. He stared down at the floor, then out the
 window at the spaceport, then at a fly on the desk. At last he stood up,
 getting slowly to his feet. "I can't even tell you that, sir," he said.

 "You can't? Why not?"

 "Because--because I promised not to."

 The room was silent. Doctor Harris rose, too, and they both stood facing
 each other. Harris frowned, rubbing his jaw. "Corporal, just _who_ did
 you promise?"

 "I can't even tell you that, sir. I'm sorry."

 The Doctor considered this. At last he went to the door and opened it.
 "All right, Corporal. You may go now. And thanks for your time."`,
  post4: `"I'm sorry I'm not more helpful." The Corporal went slowly out and
 Harris closed the door after him. Then he went across his office to the
 vidphone. He rang Commander Cox's letter. A moment later the beefy
 good-natured face of the Base Commander appeared.

 "Cox, this is Harris. I talked to him, all right. All I could get is the
 statement that he's a plant. What else is there? What kind of behavior
 pattern?"

 "Well," Cox said, "the first thing they noticed was that he wouldn't do
 any work. The Garrison Chief reported that this Westerburg would wander
 off outside the Garrison and just sit, all day long. Just sit."

 "In the sun?"

 "Yes. Just sit in the sun. Then at nightfall he would come back in. When
 they asked why he wasn't working in the jet repair building he told them
 he had to be out in the sun. Then he said--" Cox hesitated.

 "Yes? Said what?"

 "He said that work was unnatural. That it was a waste of time. That the
 only worthwhile thing was to sit and contemplate--outside."

 "What then?"

 "Then they asked him how he got that idea, and then he revealed to them
 that he had become a plant."

 "I'm going to have to talk to him again, I can see," Harris said. "And
 he's applied for a permanent discharge from the Patrol? What reason did
 he give?"

 "The same, that he's a plant now, and has no more interest in being a
 Patrolman. All he wants to do is sit in the sun. It's the damnedest
 thing I ever heard."

 "All right. I think I'll visit him in his quarters." Harris looked at
 his watch. "I'll go over after dinner."

 "Good luck," Cox said gloomily. "But who ever heard of a man turning
 into a plant? We told him it wasn't possible, but he just smiled at us."

 "I'll let you know how I make out," Harris said.`,
  post5: `Harris walked slowly down the hall. It was after six; the evening meal
 was over. A dim concept was coming into his mind, but it was much too
 soon to be sure. He increased his pace, turning right at the end of the
 hall. Two nurses passed, hurrying by. Westerburg was quartered with a
 buddy, a man who had been injured in a jet blast and who was now almost
 recovered. Harris came to the dorm wing and stopped, checking the
 numbers on the doors.

 "Can I help you, sir?" the robot attendant said, gliding up.

 "I'm looking for Corporal Westerburg's room."

 "Three doors to the right."

 Harris went on. Asteroid Y-3 had only recently been garrisoned and
 staffed. It had become the primary check-point to halt and examine ships
 entering the system from outer space. The Garrison made sure that no
 dangerous bacteria, fungus, or what-not arrived to infect the system. A
 nice asteroid it was, warm, well-watered, with trees and lakes and lots
 of sunlight. And the most modern Garrison in the nine planets. He shook
 his head, coming to the third door. He stopped, raising his hand and
 knocking.`,
  post6: `"Who's there?" sounded through the door.

  "I want to see Corporal Westerburg."

  The door opened. A bovine youth with horn-rimmed glasses looked out, a
  book in his hand. "Who are you?"

  "Doctor Harris."

  "I'm sorry, sir. Corporal Westerburg is asleep."

  "Would he mind if I woke him up? I want very much to talk to him."
  Harris peered inside. He could see a neat room, with a desk, a rug and
  lamp, and two bunks. On one of the bunks was Westerburg, lying face up,
  his arms folded across his chest, his eyes tightly closed.

  "Sir," the bovine youth said, "I'm afraid I can't wake him up for you,
  much as I'd like to."

  "You can't? Why not?"

  "Sir, Corporal Westerburg won't wake up, not after the sun sets. He just
  won't. He can't be wakened."

  "Cataleptic? Really?"

  "But in the morning, as soon as the sun comes up, he leaps out of bed
  and goes outside. Stays the whole day."

  "I see," the Doctor said. "Well, thanks anyhow." He went back out into
  the hall and the door shut after him. "There's more to this than I
  realized," he murmured. He went on back the way he had come.`
